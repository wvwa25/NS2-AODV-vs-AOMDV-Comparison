## Comparison of AODV and AOMDV MANET Routing Algorithms

This is a comparison of AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) and AOMDV (Ad hoc On-demand Multi-path Distance Vector) routing algorithms in NS2 Network Simulator.

To showcase the differences in the AODV and AOMDV protocols, the simulation is shown at three speeds, as follows:
* **Slow Movement**: Nodes move around the simulation area slowly
* **Fast Movement**: Nodes move around the simulation area quickly
* **No Movement**: Nodes do not move

Each of these simulation variations have the same settings, with the exception of node movement behavior. The tcl scripts for these three simulations can run using either the AODV or AOMDV routing algorithm depending on the user's choice.

### Demonstration

A video demonstration of the "Slow Movement" AODV NS2 Simulation was generated with NAM Network Animator. This demo may be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/1032554126).
