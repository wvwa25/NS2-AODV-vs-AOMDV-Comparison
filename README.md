## Comparison of AODV and AOMDV MANET Routing Algorithms in NS2 Network Simulator

This is a simulation of the AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) and AOMDV (Ad hoc On-demand Multi-path Distance Vector) routing algorithms.

#### Demonstrations

A video demonstration of the "Slow Movement" AODV NS2 Simulation may be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/1032554126). This demonstration was created with NAM network animator.
